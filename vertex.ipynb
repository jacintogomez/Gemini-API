      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters the water droplets:** As sunlight enters a raindrop, it slows down and bends. This bending of light is called refraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Light separates into colors:** Different colors of light bend at slightly different angles, causing them to separate. This separation is what creates the rainbow's spectrum of colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reflection and refraction:** The separated colors then bounce off the back of the water droplet (reflection) and are refracted again as they exit the droplet.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Observer sees the rainbow:** The observer sees the colors that are refracted at a specific angle to their eye, creating the arc-shaped rainbow. \n",
      "\n",
      "The position of the sun and the observer relative to the raindrops is crucial for seeing a rainbow. The sun must be behind the observer, and the raindrops must be in front of them. That's why rainbows are often seen in the sky opposite the sun after a rain shower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some additional points to remember:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The colors in a rainbow always appear in the same order, from red on the outside to violet on the inside.\n",
      "* The size of the rainbow depends on the size of the water droplets. Smaller droplets produce larger rainbows.\n",
      "* Rainbows can also appear in the mist of waterfalls or even in the spray of a garden hose.\n",
